TheStephenAndroidLibrary
==============

The Stephen Android library is my personal Android library that contains some helper classes for convenient use in other apps.

Features
==============

* Extra widgets - A TextView that automatically fades between multiple words, and a pie ProgressBar
* Version and log control
* Google Play purchase helpers
* An orientation listener that will automatically rotate views based on the device's orientation
* A Lazy image loader
* Extensions to Apache HTTP that allow downloading/ uploading with progress reports
* Other assorted helpers

Requirements
=============

The library is meant to be used in conjunction with the excellent [HoloEverywhere library](https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere) and so you will most likely need to download this library before you'll get this one to compile properly. If you don't want to use HoloEverywhere you can just replace any references in the code from HoloEverywhere to the equivalent feature in the Android library, e.g. from org.holoeverywhere.app.Fragment to android.app.Fragment.

Other Stuff
=============

If you have questions about the use of the library or its components or just want to use it please don't hesitate to contact me through GitHub or []my personal website](http://www.nickstephen.com/).
